Pila is a simple finance manager designed for controlling
personal expenses. The app allows storing information about the
expenses, such as date, value, amount, and tags. Tags are keywords
used to describe the nature of the expenses. Tags that are used
once are stored and presented as a suggestion in future typings.

Future improvements include:
- Export to CSV files.
- Export to Google Drive.
- Management of cars: control of fuel consumption.
- Management of venues using geopositioning.
- Photos of receipts.
- Control of income.
